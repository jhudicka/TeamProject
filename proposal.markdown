# Project Proposal (Joey & Ronald)

## The Big Idea
#### Our project idea is to create a per-user Counter-Strike 2 analysis tool that takes the input of a user’s SteamID and outputs a comprehensive analysis of their last 10 matches. The user would be able to see an overview of how their last 10 matches went – from what their most played map was, to what their most used weapon was, to their average headshot percentage. From there, users would be able to analyze a particular game and see the stats of themselves and the rest of the members of the lobby. Our MVP would be to have a tool that outputs statistics over the course of their last 10 matches; however, our stretch goal is to showcase average statistics but also show a 2D render of each match so the user can see how the match went. With that said, our stretch goal will be difficult to obtain because it will require us to be able to call demos of each match alongside the base statistic data. 

## Learning Objectives
#### Since both of us are interested in the gaming and Esports industry, we wanted to work on a project related to that field. Counter-Strike 2 is a game that both of us have played and were both interested to see if we would be able to analyze the data from players’ matches and find interesting metrics. At a more individual level, Joey’s goal is to be able to use this project as a base to eventually branch off from and do other analyses on. As for Ronald, he is more interested in the process as a whole, from the ideation of the project objectives to the coding process to the ultimate end deliverable.

## Project Schedule
#### Nov 12-18:  
+ Obtain API Keys and read through documentation. 
+ Test to see how in-depth the statistics provided get. 

#### Nov 19-25: 
+ Finalize first draft of project code – results output in terminal. 

#### Nov 26-Dec 2:  
+ Start working on web-based user interface. 
+ Final draft of project code – results output in web-based user interface. 

#### Dec 3-9: 
+ Finalize web-based user interface. 
+ Debug code (if needed). 

## Collaboration Plan
#### For the most part, we plan to divide the work and incorporate it separately for most of the tasks. However, we do understand that there might be obstacles we run into, where we will need to work together, and if it comes to that point, we will undertake a pair programming approach. To ensure effective team collaboration, we have agreed to put an emphasis on communication, letting each other know how we are doing and if there are any issues we are running into. Additionally, we do plan on utilizing an agile approach, as this will hold us accountable to the timeline we are trying to meet, as well as ensuring that we discuss the pain points and if we need to make any adjustments. 

## Risks and Limitations
#### The biggest threat to our project’s success would be the complexity of the data we are able to pull from the API. We already have an idea of what sort of data we would like to pull from the API, however, if we are to run into obstacles during that process, we would have to reevaluate the scope of our project and objectives. Additionally, given the timeline of approximately four weeks, we must find ways to keep ourselves accountable by following our timeline and making sure that we are actively meeting the deadlines we are setting. 

## Additional Course Content
#### Almost all of the content from this course will be helpful to our project, but we believe the most important ones will be the lessons on API, dictionaries, functions, conditional statements, and Flask.
